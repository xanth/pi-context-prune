/**
 * Shared types for the context-prune extension.
 *
 * Design decisions (Phase 1):
 *
 * SUMMARIZATION BATCH (Ph1 step 2):
 *   One batch = one completed assistant turn with tool calls, captured from
 *   the `turn_end` event when event.toolResults.length > 0.
 *   event.message = AssistantMessage (contains ToolCall content blocks with ids)
 *   event.toolResults = ToolResultMessage[] (one per tool call in this turn)
 *
 * STATE MODEL (Ph1 step 3):
 *   - Runtime state: Map<toolCallId, ToolCallRecord> rebuilt on session_start
 *   - Session metadata: pi.appendEntry("context-prune-index", IndexEntryData)
 *     stored once per summarized batch; NOT in LLM context
 *   - User config: .pi/settings.json → "contextPrune" key (JSON merge safe,
 *     Pi preserves unknown keys when rewriting settings files)
 *
 * CONFIG FORMAT (Ph1 step 4):
 *   { "contextPrune": { "enabled": false, "summarizerModel": "default", "showPruneStatusLine": true, "showStartupNotice": true } }
 *   summarizerModel: "default" = use current active model (ctx.model)
 *                   "provider/model-id" = explicit model via ctx.modelRegistry.find()
 *
 * SUMMARY MESSAGE FORMAT (Ph1 step 5):
 *   customType: "context-prune-summary"
 *   content: <context-prune-summary> wrapped markdown with one bullet per tool call + short-id footer
 *   details: SummaryMessageDetails (toolCallRefs, toolNames, turnIndex, timestamp)
 *   The content itself includes short alias IDs in plain text so the model can
 *   reference them in future context_tree_query calls without needing details.
 *
 * API CONSTRAINTS (Ph1 step 6):
 *   - Pruning MUST happen in the `context` event via { messages: filtered },
 *     never by mutating session history (pi.appendEntry / session file untouched)
 *   - Summary injection uses pi.sendMessage(..., { deliverAs: "steer" }) from
 *     inside the turn_end handler so it lands before the next LLM call
 *   - Original full tool outputs are preserved in IndexEntryData (session custom
 *     entries) and accessible via context_tree_query at any time
 *   - v1 prunes only ToolResultMessage entries; the AssistantMessage tool-call
 *     blocks (which carry the toolCallIds) are intentionally kept so the model
 *     can still reference them when calling context_tree_query
 *   - "default" summarizer = ctx.model (current active model + its credentials),
 *     NOT a hidden side-channel. It makes an explicit LLM call from turn_end.

You have access to the context_prune tool. Use it to summarize and compact preceding tool-call results from context.

Why use context_prune:
- Pruning reduces context size, which helps you sustain longer and more complex work without running into context limits.
- Summaries preserve the important takeaways while freeing space for new reasoning and tool use.

How to decide when to prune:
- Prune at a natural task boundary. Call context_prune when the currently pending tool calls all belong to one completed task, investigation, or tightly related subtask.
- Keep each prune cohesive. Do not bundle unrelated work together; if you are about to switch to a different task, prune the completed batch first.
- A good target is usually about 8–12 related tool calls.
- Prune once that task chunk is finished and you are unlikely to need to reread every raw tool result from it again during the rest of the session.
- Avoid pruning too early: calling context_prune after every 2–3 tool calls hurts prompt-cache efficiency.
- Avoid waiting too long: letting more than about 12–13 tool calls pile up before pruning makes the eventual prune job larger and slower.

When NOT to use context_prune:
- Do NOT call it for trivial or single tool calls.
- Do NOT use it in the middle of an active task if you still expect to consult the full raw tool outputs repeatedly.

What happens when you call context_prune:
- All pending tool-call results are summarized into concise bullet points.
- The original full outputs are removed from context but preserved in the session index.
- You can retrieve the full original output at any time using the context_tree_query tool with the short refs listed in the summary.`;
